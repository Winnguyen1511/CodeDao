- mode: 0 - Normal
- petal: 0->99

-HP: 1->999 also the max HP
-level: 1->10
-antidote: 0->99
- gil: 1->999

-Events: the 3rd line: maximum 100 events
	+ Events in different castle are separated by 0.
	+ Each castle has max 20 events.
	+ Can be displayed in multiple lines. 
	+ In each castle, events will be indexed start from 1.
	when pass to new castle, the indexes will be reset to 1.

- every time the night went through an event, a petal would fall down.
- If petal == 0, and the knight has not yet won, terminate walkthrough() and return NULL.


a) If the knight meets Ultimecia and has Excalibur sword:
	-> Win, walthrough() terminate return *report.
- Without Excalibur sword -> Lose. HP = HP / 3(rounded s int), if HP < 3 -> reduceed to 1.

b) If meet Excalubur, without 3 treasures -> Cannot draw sword, continue to next event. If have all 3 -> draw sword, continue events.

c) When passing through 1 castle (each pass 0) increase level by 1. But not greater than 10.
If passed through all castle, the knight will return to the beginning.

Every time level is increase, maxHP += 100, but cannot > 999.

d) Opponent: event 1->5
	has levelO
i: ith event
	Formular:
		b = i%10;
		levelO = i > 6 (b>5? b : 5) : b;

-> Max levelO is 5.
-> If level of knight >= levelO -> win, obtain gil, 

-> If level < levelO, HP = HP - damage;
			damage = baseDamage*levelO*10;

If HP is <= 0, call callPhoenix() to revive the knight (mean that the knight is dead and has to revive :v).
	callPhoenix(): -100gil
			if gil < 100(even if gil == 0), gil = 0.
			when revived, HP = 1/2 MAX HP.(rounded)
e) Tombery:
	level formular the same
	-> Win: +1 level
	-> Lose: poisoned by next 5 level.
If poisoned, lose HP as losing even winning. (when facing opponents and Ultimecia).

	If antidote >= 1, use medicine, back to normal
	antidote == 0, if HP drop to 0 or lower(dead), summon callPhoenix(). Back to normal.

f) Queen of Cards (7):
if win, double gil.
lose, reduce half gil

g) meet Nina de Ring(8):
	Trading:
- No trading if gil < 50 gil
- if poisoned, pay 50 gil to de-poison
- If has more gil after depoisoned, convert gil -> HP (1:1 ratio)
until out of money or HP reaches MaxHp.

h) Lost into Durian Garden (9):
-> De-poisoned
-> recover maxHP
-> petal += 5

i) Pickup antidote(10): antidote +=1, if poisoned, use immediately.

k) Meet Odin(11):

l) Meet Merlin(12):
-> Depoison
-> level += 1 (Also MaxHP)
-> Restore HP to Max HP.

m) Meet Omega Weapon:
Lose, HP-> 0, has to callPhoenix()

- Except level == 10 and has Excalibur or Dragon Knight at any level with Lion Heart can defeat Omega Weapon.
- If defeat Omega, increase level -> 10. gil -> 999. 
Omega wil never reappear( just ignore the code 13 if meet again).

n) Meet Hades(14):
-> If lose, HP->0(dead), need revise. 
-> If win, obtain mythril armor. Never reduce HP, even if defeated by Hades, Omega, Ultimecia.
 But can be poisoned by Tornbery.

If Odin is helping the knight, Odin will be killed, from now on, when enter code 11, the knight will ignore.

o)Scarlet Hakama (15):
-> Not lose gil if lose Queen of Cards.
-> Not charge gil for depoisoning with Nina. and exchanging HP.
-> Enter the Durian Garden, petals will increase to 99.

p) LockedDoor(16):
-> If meet LockedDoor at ith event, if level > i% 10, pass
	else leave the castle(leave all events in that castle), level and MaxHP is still remain the same.
