hello, my name is khoa. 21 year-old and i am an senior student in embedded system. nice to meet you. :v
i've studied es for 4 years, and i feel like i'm not very good at all. though i have many skills in
embedded system, i think i need to consolidate my skills even more and improve my soft skills also.
after all, i want to be master in embedded system and be a good teammate in my community, especially in my company.
